# Introduction
This software is used to solve the SalesTaxes problem. I apply different taxes (basic taxes and import duties) to the products, some products are exempted from basic taxes (like food, medical products and books), then I print the resulting receipt of the purchase.

# Compile
To run the tests, you will need to use this command line in the main folder of this program : `mvn test`.

To compile the main program, from the main folder, go in "src/main/java" and then use this command line : `javac Main.java`.

From "src/main/java" you can also run the program, you will need to type this command line: `java Main`.
